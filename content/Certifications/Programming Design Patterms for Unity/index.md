### **Course Description**

This course is designed to help intermediate Unity developers improve their **code quality, structure, and maintainability** by mastering **programming best practices** and **design patterns**.

You’ll learn how to identify and correct bad coding habits, refactor messy code, and apply proven **programming patterns** to real Unity projects. The course explains when and why to use patterns, how they promote clean architecture, and how to implement them effectively in game development.

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to:

* Recognize and eliminate poor coding practices
* Refactor and optimize existing code
* Understand and apply common design patterns in Unity
* Use patterns to manage complexity in larger game projects

A solid understanding of **C# fundamentals** (classes, methods, conditionals, loops) and familiarity with **object-oriented concepts** (inheritance, interfaces, events) is required. Support is available through Q&A forums with instructors and teaching assistants.
