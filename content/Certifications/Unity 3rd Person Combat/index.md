### **Course Description**

This course teaches you how to build a fully functional **third-person action combat system** in **Unity 2022.1**, inspired by games such as *Dark Souls* and *Assassin’s Creed*. You will design and implement mechanics that can be integrated into any third-person or RPG project.

Key topics include **player input**, **animation state machines**, **attack combos**, **dodging**, **target locking**, **Cinemachine camera setup**, and **basic enemy AI**.

By the end of the course, you’ll have developed a complete **sandbox combat arena** featuring responsive third-person controls compatible with both keyboard/mouse and game controllers.

The course is intended for **beginner to intermediate** Unity users with basic knowledge of the Unity interface and C#. Support is available through Q&A forums with instructors and teaching assistants.
