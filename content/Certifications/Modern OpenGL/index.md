### **Course Description**

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to **modern OpenGL programming** using the **programmable rendering pipeline**. Unlike outdated tutorials focused on the fixed-function pipeline, this course teaches the efficient, flexible, and performance-oriented approach used in today’s graphics applications.

You’ll start by setting up OpenGL with **GLFW** and progress to rendering polygons by sending data to the GPU and programming shaders with **GLSL**. You’ll also learn to **apply textures**, **control a virtual camera** using keyboard and mouse input, **load 3D models**, and **implement dynamic lighting**.

Each lesson builds upon the last, guiding you from a blank project to a complete **3D rendering framework** in C++ and OpenGL — a solid foundation for developing your own game engine or graphics applications.

All source code, pre-built libraries, and Visual Studio project files are included to support your learning process.
