### **Course Description**

This course is designed to help you **advance your Unity development skills** by building a complete **menu and data management system** from the ground up. Starting with a simple Unity project, you’ll learn to design and implement a professional front-end menu, manage scene transitions, and handle **persistent data saving and loading**.

Key topics include:

* Building **reusable UI components** and scene transitions
* Implementing **data persistence** using `PlayerPrefs` and `JsonUtility`
* Applying the **Singleton design pattern**, **statics**, and **generics** for clean, reusable code
* Writing structured **C# scripts** to architect scalable game systems

By the end of the course, you’ll have a fully functional **menu and save/load framework** ready to integrate into your own Unity projects.

The course includes **40+ concise lessons** (10–15 minutes each), totaling over **6 hours of guided instruction**, with updated project files.
